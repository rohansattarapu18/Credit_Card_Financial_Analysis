### SQL Queries
- SQL queries are designed to extract necessary data from a SQL Server, which is then used to populate the dashboards in Power BI. The specific details of these queries weren't directly accessible, but they presumably include joins, aggregations, and filters to prepare the dataset for visualization.

### Analysis and DAX Commands
- Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI to create calculated columns, measures, and other complex aggregations necessary for the dashboards. This might include summing up transactions, calculating average revenues, and other financial metrics.

### Data and Metrics
- The dashboards provide a comprehensive view of customer interactions and financial transactions, highlighting key metrics that could inform business decisions, such as targeting specific customer segments or adjusting service offerings based on transaction types.
